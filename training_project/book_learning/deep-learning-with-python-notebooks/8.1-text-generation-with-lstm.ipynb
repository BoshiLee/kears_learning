    "* We can generate discrete sequence data by training a model to predict the next tokens(s) given previous tokens.\n",
    "* In the case of text, such a model is called a \"language model\" and could be based on either words or characters.\n",
    "* Sampling the next token requires balance between adhering to what the model judges likely, and introducing randomness.\n",
    "* One way to handle this is the notion of _softmax temperature_. Always experiment with different temperatures to find the \"right\" one."
